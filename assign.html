  My name is kevin and I am pursuing a Bachelor of Computer science in University of winsor. I'm form Ahmedabad, India and I've been living in Windsor for the past 1 year. Moreover, this is my first year as a university student. I didn't get the chance to attend any offline lecture because of the pandemic but im ver much looking forward to attendinf the offline lectures and meeting new people. However , I am also enjoying online lectures because If you miss any lectures, you can watch recorded videos and help you to manage time properly without missing any studies.

  I don’t play sports that much after coming to windsor. But I used to play badminton and do swimming in my high school. I have also tried so many adventurous sports like scuba diving, snorkelling, rafting and hiking. Swimming is like mediation for me. When I am in the water, I forget about everything else and just move my body in water. Recently, I started liking to play and learn chess. Chess is very addictive, once you start playing and get to understand the game it’s become more and more fascinating. By playing chess you get the adrenaline running while sitting in your room.

  I also like to travel to different countries and try new things. I have travelled to most cities in India. Moreover, I have been to Thailand and Dubai. After I finish my undergraduate I’m planning to travel Japan, America and Europe. I don’t know whether I will manage to fulfill all my plans or not but I will try my best. I also watch anime in my free time. That's the main reason I wanted to travel to Japan because I love everything associated with this country. I also learned some of the japanese words while watching anime. Moreover, I have started reading books to spend some time.
